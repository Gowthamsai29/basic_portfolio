          <h2>Abstract</h2>
          <p>
            The rapid advancements in technology have opened new avenues for
            enhancing security and efficiency in educational institutions. This
            project focuses on developing a mobile application for NIT Warangal
            that leverages QR code scanning to streamline the process of
            tracking student activities. Traditional methods such as manual
            attendance logs and biometric systems present several limitations,
            including inefficiency, susceptibility to errors, and
            ineffectiveness during pandemics. The proposed system addresses
            these issues by providing a secure, reliable, and user-friendly
            solution for security officers.

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            In today's fast-paced world, ensuring the security and efficient
            management of student movements within educational institutions is
            paramount. National Institute of Technology Warangal (NITW) is no
            exception, with its large campus and substantial student body
            necessitating robust and streamlined security protocols. Traditional
            methods of monitoring student entry and exit, such as manual
            logbooks, are not only time-consuming but also prone to errors and
            inefficiencies.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
          <p>
            The current system for tracking student entry and exit at NITW
            involves manual logging and biometric systems. While biometrics
            offer certain advantages, they also present significant challenges.
            The biometric machines often overheat, fail to capture impressions
            accurately, and are not viable during health crises such as the
            COVID-19 pandemic. Manual logging, on the other hand, is
            inefficient, prone to human error, and lacks real-time data
            accessibility. There is a clear need for a more accurate, efficient,
            and reliable system to monitor student movements. Our project aims
            to address these issues by leveraging QR code technology to automate
            the tracking process, ensuring precise and timely records of student
            entries and exits.

          <h2>Literature about Similar Works</h2>
          <p>
            Several institutions have implemented automated attendance and
            tracking systems using various technologies such as RFID, biometric
            scanning, and mobile applications. RFID systems, while effective,
            can be costly and require substantial infrastructure changes.
            Biometric systems offer high accuracy but are susceptible to issues
            such as overheating, failed impressions, and are unsuitable during
            pandemics due to hygiene concerns. Mobile applications using QR
            codes have emerged as a cost-effective and efficient alternative,
            offering ease of use and minimal infrastructure requirements. These
            applications ensure contactless operation, which is crucial during
            health crises, and provide real-time data for improved monitoring
            and security.

          <h2>Proposed System</h2>
          <p>
            The proposed system is a mobile application that uses QR code
            scanning to track student activities. The application is designed to
            provide a user-friendly interface for security officers to log in,
            scan QR codes, and manage scanned data. The main features include
            user authentication via phone number and OTP, QR code scanning,
            timestamping of scanned data, and options to mark and share
            suspicious entries.

              Phone Number Entry: Security officers enter their phone number on
              the launcher page.
            </li>
            <li>

              Initiate Scanner: The officer taps the "Scan QR" button, prompting
              the app to request camera permission.
            </li>
            <li>
              Permission Handling: If the officer denies permission, the app
              will request it two more times. If permission is still denied, the
              app crashes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Scanning Process: Once permission is granted, the scanner
              activates, capturing the QR code and timestamping the scan.
